# streamline.js

`streamline.js` is a language tool to simplify asynchronous Javascript programming.

Instead of writing hairy code like:

```javascript
function archiveOrders(date, cb) {
  db.connect(function(err, conn) {
    if (err) return cb(err);
    conn.query("select * from orders where date < ?", [date], function(err, orders) {
      if (err) return cb(err);
      helper.each(orders, function(order, next) {
        conn.execute("insert into archivedOrders ...", [order.id, ...], function(err) {
          if (err) return cb(err);
          conn.execute("delete from orders where id=?", [order.id], function(err) {
            if (err) return cb(err);
            next();
          });
        });
      }, function() {
        console.log("orders have been archived");
        cb();
      });
    });
  });
}
```

you write:

```javascript
function archiveOrders(date, _) {
  var conn = db.connect(_);
  conn.query("select * from orders where date < ?", [date], _).forEach_(_, function(_, order) {
    conn.execute("insert into archivedOrders ...", [order.id, ...], _);
    conn.execute("delete from orders where id=?", [order.id], _);
  });
  console.log("orders have been archived");
}
```

and streamline transforms the code and takes care of the callbacks!

No flow control APIs to learn! You just have to follow a simple rule:

> Replace all callbacks by an underscore and write your code as if all functions were synchronous.

Streamline is not limited to a subset of Javascript. 
You can use all the features of Javascript in your asynchronous code: conditionals, 
loops, `try/catch/finally` blocks, anonymous functions, chaining, `this`, etc. 

Streamline also provides _futures_, and asynchronous variants of the EcmaScript 5 array functions (`forEach`, `map`, etc.).

# Installation

NPM, of course: 

```sh
npm install streamline -g
```

The `-g` option installs streamline _globally_.
You can also install it _locally_, without `-g` but then the `_node` and `_coffee` 
commands will not be in your default PATH.

Note: If you encounter a permission error when installing on UNIX systems, you should retry with `sudo`. 

If you want to use the _fibers_ option (see below), you must also install the fibers library:

```sh
npm install fibers [-g]
```

# Hello World

Streamline modules have `._js` or `._coffee` extensions and you run them with the `_node` or `_coffee` 
loader.

Javascripters:

``` sh
$ cat > hello._js
console.log('hello ...');
setTimeout(_, 1000);
console.log('... world');
^D
$ _node hello
```

Coffeescripters:

``` sh
$ cat > hello._coffee
console.log 'hello ...'
setTimeout _, 1000
console.log '... world'
^D
$ _coffee hello
```

You can also create standalone shell utilities:

``` sh
$ cat > hello.sh
#!/usr/bin/env _node
console.log('hello ...');
setTimeout(_, 1000);
console.log('... world');
^D
$ ./hello.sh
```

or:

``` sh
$ cat > hello.sh
#!/usr/bin/env _coffee
console.log 'hello ...'
setTimeout _, 1000
console.log '... world'
^D
$ ./hello.sh
```

# Compiling and writing loaders

You can also set up your code so that it can be run directly with `node` or `coffee.
You have two options here:

The first one is to compile your source with `_node -c` or `_coffee -c`:

``` sh
$ _node -c .
```

This command compiles all the `*._js` and `*._coffee` source files in the current directory and its sub-directories. It generates `*.js` files that you can run directly with `node`.

The second one is to create your own loader with the `register` API. See the [loader example](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/blob/master/examples/loader/loader.md) for details.

Compiling will give you the fastest startup time because node will directly load the compiled `*.js` files but the `register` API has a `cache` option which comes close and the loader saves you a compilation pass.

# Browser-side use

You have three options to use streamline in the browser:

* The first one is to compile the source with `_node -c`. The compiler generates vanilla Javascript code that you can load with `<script>` directives in an HTML page. See the [flows unit test](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/blob/master/test/common/flows-test.html) for an example.
* You can also transform the code in the browser with the `transform` API. See the [streamlineMe example](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/blob/master/examples/streamlineMe).
* A third option is to use the [streamline-require](https://github.com/Sage/streamline-require) infrastructure. This is a very efficient browser-side implementation of `require` that lets you load streamlined modules as well as vanilla Javascript modules in the browser. 

# Generation options

Streamline gives you the choice between generating regular callback-based asynchronous code, 
generating code that takes advantage of the [fibers library](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers), 
or generating code for [JavaScript generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Generators).

The _callback_ option produces code that does not have any special runtime dependencies. 

The _fibers_ option produces simpler code but requires that you install 
the fibers library (easy: `npm install fibers`). 
This option gives superior development experience: line numbers and comments are preserved in the transformed code; 
you can step with the debugger through asynchronous calls without having to go through complex callbacks, etc.

The _fibers_ option can be activated by passing the `--fibers` option to the `_node` command or by 
setting the `fibers` option when registering streamline 
(see the `streamline.register(options)` function.

The _generators_ option is more experimental (but rather solid as it passes all unit tests). 
It produces code that is similar to the _fibers_ option, although slightly more complex. 
Like the _fibers_ option, it preserves line numbers and comments. 
This option does _not_ yet work in node.js because V8 does not currently support generators but it works in Firefox and in [luvmonkey](https://github.com/creationix/luvmonkey). 
It should work, with minor tweaks, in future versions of V8 that may implement [Harmony generators](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators).
 
# Interoperability with standard node.js code

You can call standard node functions from streamline code. For example the `fs.readFile` function:

```javascript
function lineCount(path, _) {
  return fs.readFile(path, "utf8", _).split('\n').length;
}
```
You can also call streamline functions as if they were standard node functions. For example, the `lineCount` function defined above can be called as follows from non-streamlined modules:

```javascript
lineCount("README.md", function(err, result) {
  if (err) return console.error("ERROR: " + err.message);
  console.log("README has " + result + " lines.");
});
```

And you can mix streamline functions, classical callback based code and synchrononous functions in the same file. 
Streamline only transforms the functions that have the special `_` parameter. 

Note: this works with all transformation options. 
Even if you use the _fibers_ option, you can seamlessly call standard callback based node APIs 
and the asynchronous functions that you create with streamline have the standard node callback signature.

# Futures

Streamline provides _futures_, a powerful feature that lets you parallelize I/O operations in a very
simple manner.

If you omit the callback (or pass a `null` callback) when calling a streamline function, the function will execute synchronously and return a _future_. The _future_ is just an asynchronous function that you can call later to obtain a result. Here is an example:

```javascript
function countLines(path, _) {
  return fs.readFile(path, "utf8", _).split('\n').length;
}

function compareLineCounts(path1, path2, _) {
  // parallelize the two countLines operations
  var n1 = countLines(path1);
  var n2 = countLines(path2);
  // get the results and diff them
  return n1(_) - n2(_);
}
```

In this example, `countLines` is called twice without `_` parameter. These calls start the `fs.readFile` asynchronous operations and return immediately two _futures_ (`n1` and `n2`). The `return` statement retrieves the results with `n1(_)` and `n2(_)` calls and computes their difference. 

Futures are very flexible. In the example above, the results are retrieved from the same function, but you can also pass futures to other functions, store them in objects, call them to get the results from a different module, etc. You can also have several readers on the same future. 

See the [futures](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/wiki/Futures) wiki page for details.

The [flows module](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/blob/master/lib/util/flows.md) contains utilities to deal with futures: 
`flows.collect` to wait on an array of futures and `flows.funnel` to limit the number of concurrent operations.

# Asynchronous Array functions

Streamline extends the Array prototype with asynchronous variants of the EcmaScript 5 `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, ... functions. These asynchronous variants are postfixed with an underscore and they take an extra `_` argument (their callback too), but they are otherwise similar to the standard ES5 functions. Here is an example with the `map_` function:

``` javascript
function dirLines(dir, _) {
  return fs.readdir(dir, _).map_(_, function(_, file) {
    return fs.readFile(dir + '/' + file, 'utf8', _).split('\n').length;
  });
}
```

Parallelizing loops is easy: just pass the number of parallel operations as second argument to the call:

``` javascript
function dirLines(dir, _) {
  // process 8 files in parallel
  return fs.readdir(dir, _).map_(_, 8, function(_, file) {
    return fs.readFile(dir + '/' + file, 'utf8', _).split('\n').length;
  });
}
```

If you don't want to limit the level of parallelism, just pass `-1`.

See the documentation of the [builtins module](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/blob/master/lib/compiler/builtins.md) for details.

# Exception Handling

Streamline lets you do your exception handling with the usual `try/catch` construct. The `finally` clause is also supported.

Streamline overrides the `ex.stack` getter to give you the stack of streamline calls rather than the last callback stack. You can still get the native callback stack trace with `ex.rawStack`.

Exception handling also works with futures.
If a future throws an exception before you try to read its result, the exception will be memorized by the future and you will get it at the point where your try to read the result. 
For example:

``` javascript
try {
  var n1 = countLines(badPath);
  var n2 = countLines(goodPath);
  setTimeout(_, 1000); // n1 fails, exception is memorized
  return n1(_) - n2(_); // exception is thrown by n1(_) expression.
} catch (ex) {
  console.error(ex.stack); // exception caught here
}
```

# Stream Wrappers

Streamline also provides _stream wrappers_ that simplify stream programming. The [streams module](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/blob/master/lib/streams/server/streams.md) contains:

* a generic `ReadableStream` wrapper with an asynchronous `stream.read(_[, len])` method.
* a generic `WritableStream` wrapper with an asynchronous `stream.write(_, buf[, encoding])` method.
* wrappers for HTTP and TCP request and response objects (client and server).

# Examples

The [diskUsage](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/blob/master/examples/diskUsage) examples shows an asynchronous directory traversal that computes disk usage.
You can run it as follows:

```sh
_node streamline/examples/diskUsage/diskUsage
```

The `diskUsage2` example is a faster variant that parallelizes I/O operations with futures. 
You'll also find CoffeeScript versions of these examples.
